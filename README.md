# gem-x.cpp

Turn webcam movements or recorded videos into an animated 3D human skeleton.
Built on [NVIDIA GEM-X](https://github.com/NVlabs/GEM-X), gem-x.cpp runs locally
and includes a browser demo for viewing the results.

- **Live webcam:** see your movements as a continuously updated skeleton, either
  overlaid on the camera image or in a 3D view.
- **Recorded video:** upload a clip or record one with your webcam, inspect the
  reconstructed motion, and export an animated GLB for use in 3D tools.

Robot control and SONIC integration are not included yet.

## Use the demo

Once installed using the steps below, start the demo from the repository root:

```sh
./demo/gemx-demo --threads 8
```

Open **http://localhost:8098** in your browser.

### Live webcam

1. Select **Live webcam**, press **Start live**, and allow camera access.
2. Keep the camera stationary and your full body in view.
3. Switch between the camera overlay and 3D skeleton view to inspect the motion.

**Detect person every N frames** controls how often the person detector runs.
The default is 5; use 1 when moving around, or a larger interval when staying
in the same area to reduce processing work. Pose inference still runs on each
processed frame.

**Stop inference** returns the preview to your webcam. **Close camera** releases
the camera. Camera access needs localhost or HTTPS when accessing the demo
from another device.

### Recorded video

Select **Offline video**, then upload a video or record a webcam clip. Press **Build motion**, inspect the skeleton alongside the video, then select
**Download animated GLB**. Clips are limited to 120 sampled frames.

Offline processing uses the included `sam3d.cpp` submodule and its Body model
assets. Live webcam mode does not need them.
See the [demo guide](demo/README.md) for configuration and controls.

## Install

Linux is the tested platform. You need Git, a C++23 compiler (GCC 13+ or
Clang 17+), CMake 3.24+, Ninja, and Go 1.23+ for the browser demo.

### 1. Build

From your checkout, fetch the dependencies:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

For GPU inference, install the Vulkan development packages, `glslc`, and SPIR-V
headers (`libvulkan-dev glslc spirv-headers` on Debian/Ubuntu), then build:

```sh
cmake --preset vulkan
cmake --build --preset vulkan -j8
```

Build the browser demo:

```sh
(cd demo && GOMAXPROCS=8 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -p 8 -o gemx-demo .)
```

For CPU inference, build with the `release` preset instead and launch with:

```sh
./demo/gemx-demo --threads 8 \
  --pipeline build/release/gemx-pipeline \
  --backend CPU --module build/release/bin
```

### 2. Prepare the models

Model weights are separate from the source checkout. Follow the
[model preparation instructions](distribution/README.md) to obtain and convert
the required models. The demo expects these files by default:

```text
generated/reference/gem-x-contact-f32.gguf
generated/reference/vitpose-f32.gguf
generated/reference/yolox-f32.gguf
```

You can override model locations and select a GPU with command-line flags;
run `./demo/gemx-demo --help` for the options. For offline video, also build the
included SAM3D worker and prepare its Body models using the [offline setup instructions](demo/README.md#offline-dependency-setup).

### 3. Start the demo

Run `./demo/gemx-demo --threads 8` from the repository root, then open
**http://localhost:8098**. The default configuration uses the Vulkan build.
