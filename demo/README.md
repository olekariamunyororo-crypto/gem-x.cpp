# GEM-X camera and video demo

Choose **Live webcam** to see continuous skeleton updates, or **Offline video**
to process a complete uploaded video or webcam recording and export a GLB.

With detection interval 1, live mode follows upstream's camera example: one-frame person detection and
ViTPose, a 30-frame rolling GEM window, two-frame warm-up, and only the newest
pose displayed. It omits SAM3D Body, contact refinement and world trajectory.
The 3D view uses that frame's shape and gravity-aligned orientation. The camera
overlay uses the exact captured frame associated with the displayed pose.

Press **Start live**, grant camera permission, and keep the camera stationary
with your full body in view. You can choose a camera after opening it. The rate
cap limits capture; the displayed rate and frame age reflect actual processing.
**Detect person every N frames** is configurable from 1 to 30 before starting
a session (initial value 5). Larger intervals reuse the last person crop while
ViTPose and GEM still run on every processed frame. Stay in the same area while
moving your limbs; this is crop reuse, not a motion tracker. Choose 1 for the
upstream detection cadence or when moving around. Detection retries every frame
after a miss and refreshes on reset, size change or a pause over two seconds.
The live rate cap starts at 20 fps so it does not hide the reduced-detection gain.
**Stop inference** releases the worker and returns the shared preview to the
webcam. **Close camera** then releases the camera. While inference runs, this
same viewport displays the captured frame with its skeleton, or the 3D view. Hiding the tab pauses live capture; restart
clears temporal context. Live frames/results are temporary and are removed on
stop or idle expiry. Offline and live inference share one GPU slot.

Camera access requires localhost or HTTPS. Remote plain HTTP can still process
uploaded videos. Live mode can run without SAM3D Body assets installed; those
assets are needed for offline jobs.

The offline path uses future context from the complete clip.

Native ViTPose automatically uses the [validated optimization defaults](../docs/VITPOSE-DEFAULTS.md); no performance environment flags are needed.

The native stages are:

1. YOLOX plus ByteTrack detects people, selects the dominant track, fills
   missing boxes and applies a symmetric five-frame smoothing window.
2. SAM 3D Body emits the 1024-value pose token expected by GEM-X for each
   tracked crop.
3. ViTPose produces the 77 two-dimensional keypoints.
4. GEM-X runs once over the full sequence, builds world- and camera-space SOMA
   skeletons, overlays the camera projection and ViTPose observations on the
   synchronized clip, and exports an animated GLB.

Clips are limited to 120 sampled frames, the context length covered by the
current parity work. The browser scales frames to at most 960 pixels on the
long edge before uploading them.

From the repository root:

```sh
cd demo
GOMAXPROCS=8 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -p 8 -o gemx-demo .
cd ..
./demo/gemx-demo --threads 8
```

All paths have repository-relative defaults. No GPU model name is required. Use the command-line flags when the
SAM3D build or model files are elsewhere. `--threads` is
validated to a maximum of eight.

The implementation follows and credits
[NVlabs/GEM-X](https://github.com/NVlabs/GEM-X) and uses the pose feature path
from [facebookresearch/sam-3d-body](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-body).

The default configuration uses strict F32 inference, F32 Body features and
upstream contact correction/grounding/IK. It requires
`generated/reference/gem-x-contact-f32.gguf`, converted with `--checkpoint`.
See [the parity report](../docs/LIVE-OFFLINE-PARITY.md) for conversion and
validation. `--strict=false --bf16 --contacts=false` selects the approximate
configuration; measurements from it should not be labelled strict parity.

The resident native worker is `gemx-pipeline --live-worker`; it uses the same
models and strict precision setting as the demo. The browser keeps at most two
frames in flight: one being inferred and one being prepared/uploaded. It times
capture of the next frame near the expected completion of the current one,
using measured inference, encoding and transport costs to limit frame age.
Independent image buffers keep each overlay matched to its source frame.

`POST /api/live?pipeline=2` enables the bounded pipeline. Each frame PUT must
include a one-based `X-GEMX-Frame` header. Upload/decode can overlap inference,
but the native worker still processes frames strictly in sequence; duplicate
or out-of-window requests receive 409. A failed admitted frame ends the session
rather than silently changing temporal history. Requests without the pipeline
option retain the serial API. `Server-Timing` exposes preparation, queue wait,
packed-image write and native inference durations for profiling.

The server expires idle sessions after 30 seconds and bounds startup/inference
to 120 seconds. A gap over two seconds resets native temporal
history. A stale pose disappears from the browser after two seconds.
The worker accepts an optional final `DETECT_INTERVAL` argument, defaulting to
1. `POST /api/live?detect_interval=N` selects it; requests without the option
retain interval 1. Offline processing is unchanged.

Validation includes Go lifecycle tests, lossless 72-frame HTTP replay using
`scripts/qa_live_http.py`, and simulated-webcam Chromium checks using
`scripts/qa_live_browser.py`. The latter tests real native inference but does
not establish physical webcam quality or camera-to-robot latency. SONIC
publishing is not connected to this demo.

Recorded results: [live demo validation](../docs/live-demo-validation-2026-09-18.json).

See [live pipeline measurements](../docs/LIVE-PIPELINING.md) for throughput, GPU counters, latency tradeoffs and byte-level replay checks.

For a CPU build, use `--pipeline build/release/gemx-pipeline --backend CPU
--module build/release/bin`. The backend directory selects a compatible CPU
variant. `--device N` selects the device; `--device-name NAME` optionally checks
its description. `--listen` and `--data` configure deployment and storage.
Run `./demo/gemx-demo --help` for all model and SAM3D path overrides. The
`--body-runner`, `--body-module`, `--backbone`, `--branch` and `--mhr` options
override the included SAM3D submodule paths; live mode does not need it.

The server has no authentication; use localhost or a trusted authenticated
reverse proxy. Uploaded video is decoded by the browser; the server accepts
size-limited JPEG/PNG frames.

## Offline dependency setup

`sam3d.cpp/` is a pinned Git submodule. From the GEM-X repository root, fetch it
and its dependencies, then build its Body worker:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
(cd sam3d.cpp && cmake --preset vulkan-bf16-production && cmake --build --preset vulkan-bf16-production -j8)
```

This build uses the Vulkan toolchain described in the main README. The preset
name enables support for BF16 optimizations; the GEM-X demo still uses F32 Body
inference by default. Its output directory is `build/vulkan-bf16-performance`.

Prepare the three Body GGUFs using the submodule's
[reference setup](../sam3d.cpp/reference/README.md) and
[conversion guide](../sam3d.cpp/reference/GGUF.md). Model files are not fetched
by Git. The default paths, relative to the GEM-X repository root, are:

```text
sam3d.cpp/generated/models/sam-3d-body-dinov3/body-dinov3-f32.gguf
sam3d.cpp/generated/models/sam-3d-body-dinov3/body-pose-branch-f32.gguf
sam3d.cpp/generated/models/mhr-public/mhr-lod1-f32.gguf
```

The demo automatically looks for the worker and Vulkan module in
`sam3d.cpp/build/vulkan-bf16-performance/bin/`. Use the path overrides above
if reusing an existing SAM3D installation. Live-only users can skip this build
and the Body model preparation.
